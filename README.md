# chat-with-csv-using-langchain-openai

creating a chatbot to interact with CSV files using OpenAI's LLMs and langchain.

With LangChain's framework, I have develop language model-powered application that are aware of data and can interact with their environment.

Further more , I have kept the interface simple and the previous questions asked by the user will be their in the conversational history . 

So that the user knows what all questions he has asked and which questions he has not.
